# Advent Of Code 2017

All the code should be runnable by typing

    $ cat day<n>-puzzle.txt | stack runhaskell day<n>.hs

Each file can also be compiled with

    $ stack ghc day<n>

and then ran with

    $ cat day<n>-puzzle.txt | ./day<n>


The commands above assumes that [stack](http://www.haskellstack.org)
is installed and operational.
